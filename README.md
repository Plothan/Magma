Magma is a modern, reactive state management library built for [Roblox](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/) and [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/). 

#### Why Magma
Magma is a truly reactive state management library that is very easy to migrate to. While Magma provides you the well-known state management pattern with Gems and listeners, it provides a specialized object called "ReGem" that update once any of their dependencies change.

#### Install Magma
To install Magma for studio or rojo workflows, follow the following instructions:

1. For Rojo: Go the release you wish to install, and then download the source code zip file, and then copy the src file and rename it to `Magma` and put it in the `shared` folder.

2. for Roblox Studio: Go to the release yoou wish to install, and search for the `.rbxm` file and then download it. After that, place it in the `ReplicatedStorage`.
