Magma is an efficient, modern and reactive state management library built specifically for [Roblox](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/) and [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/).



!!! caution "Magma is still in beta!"
    Magma is still in the beta stage, which means that many features may get a new behavior, get removed entirely, or still not implemented., as such, you aren't recommended to use Magma in production unless you will be able to withstand major changes within releases.

    However, this is also the perfect time for you to suggest new ideas so that we can move from counterproductive patterns!
